# COP Participants

I provided Python notebooks to extract statistics about the participants at the
UN climate conferences (the Conference of the Parties, or COP) from
the provisional list of participants (= accredited persons) at
- [COP24](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/PLOP.pdf),
- [COP25](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/COP%2025_Provisional%20List%20of%20Participants.pdf).
